For steering, a mobile phone attached to the handlebars can also be used. For this, use "Remote Gamepad" or a similar app and configure the tilt as steering input (and buttons).
To set up, run the "0_Read_Bluetooth_Devices.py" script and copy the relevant address. Add it to the control scripts.
To run the script "1_MarioKart_ZwiftPlay_to_Keyboard.py" and one of (2-7) needs to run in separate terminal windows.
